# Virgin Media Broadband and the lack of IPv6

This is a little project designed to inform any customer of Virgin Media Broadband in the UK about the lack of IPv6.

Why should you care? Well because IPv6 is the future and Virgin Media won't get with the times. Also you might be thinking, whatever loser, use an IPv6 tunnel. HA. Good luck, Virgin Media can't do that right either.

The website is at [havevirginmediaenabledipv6yet.co.uk](https://havevirginmediaenabledipv6yet.co.uk) (Yes I actually paid for a custom domain for maximum trolling).

Obviously not associated with Virgin Media etc.
