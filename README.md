# Virgin Media UK Broadband and the lack of IPv6

This is a little project designed to inform any customer of Virgin Media Broadband in the UK about the lack of IPv6 and some of the interesting issues around IPv6 workarounds.

Why should you care? Well because IPv6 is the future and Virgin Media won't get with the times. Also you might be thinking, whatever loser, use an IPv6 tunnel what's the big deal? HA. Good luck, Virgin Media won't let you do that without hassle either.

The website of this project is at [havevirginmediaenabledipv6yet.co.uk](https://havevirginmediaenabledipv6yet.co.uk) (Yes I actually paid for a custom domain for maximum trolling). Tell your friends.

Obviously not associated with Virgin Media etc.
